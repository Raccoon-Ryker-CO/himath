            <h2>Operations</h2>
            <h3>Plus</h3>
            <p>Plus is adding numbers together so for example:<br>
            1 + 1 is equal to 2.</p>
            <h3>Minus</h3>
            <p>Minus is removing numbers so think of 2 - 1 being 1.<br>That is because we are removing 1 from 2.</p>
            <h3>Multiplication</h3>
            <p style="color: red;">Things are gonna get tricky!</p>
            <p>Multiplication is all about skip-counting so if we did 5 * 5,<br>We would need to skip-count by 5's 5 times like this: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25. So the answer is 25.</p>
            <h3>Division</h3>
            <p>If you know multiplication, Division is the oppisite of multiplication so<br>if we had a multiplication question and we had to convert it into division,<br>we need to put the answer of the multiplication question into the first number of the division question and the first<br>number of the multiplication question is the answer of the division question so 25 / 5 would equal 5 because 5 * 5 equals 25.</p>
            </div>
            <p>If that did not work, How about a Multiplication chart?</p>

            <p>But if that did not work, I'm sorry. I cannot give you any help now.</p>
